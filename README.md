**BookLet** is a *Progressive Web Application* (*PWA*) that's made to help students **practice**, and **learn** accounting concepts.
It works without internet or a laptop, giving you — the user — the power of portability anywhere you go.  
It's like your personal workbook but digital, portable, and interactive.  
Perfect for *Accountancy and Business Management* (*ABM*) students, self-learners, or anyone curious 'bout how businesses track their money.
